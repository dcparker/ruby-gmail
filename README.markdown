# Notice

I have pushed verion 0.3.1 to rubygems.org (Yay, thanks Nick Quaranto for the help) which is a build straight from master.

Second, this gem is getting back on track. See [this issue here](https://github.com/dcparker/ruby-gmail/issues/58) for more information.

## Description

A Rubyesque interface to Gmail, with all the tools you'll need. Search, read and send multipart emails; archive, mark as read/unread, delete emails; and manage labels.

## Features

* Search emails
* Read emails (handles attachments)
* Emails: Label, archive, delete, mark as read/unread/spam
* Create and delete labels
* Create and send multipart email messages in plaintext and/or html, with inline images and attachments
* Utilizes Gmail's IMAP & SMTP, MIME-type detection and parses and generates MIME properly.

## Problems:

* May not correctly read malformed MIME messages. This could possibly be corrected by having IMAP parse the MIME structure.
* Cannot grab the plain or html message without also grabbing attachments. It might be nice to lazy-[down]load attachments.

## Example Code:

### 1) Require gmail
```ruby
require 'gmail'
```
    
### 2) Start an authenticated gmail session
```ruby
# If you pass a block, the session will be passed into the block,
# and the session will be logged out after the block is executed.
gmail = Gmail.new(username, password)
# ...do things...
gmail.logout
```

```ruby
Gmail.new(username, password) do |gmail|
  # ...do things...
end
```

### 3) Count and gather emails!
```ruby
# Get counts for messages in the inbox
gmail.inbox.count
gmail.inbox.count(:unread)
gmail.inbox.count(:read)
```

```ruby
# Count with some criteria
gmail.inbox.count(after: Date.parse('2010-02-20'), before: Date.parse('2010-03-20'))
gmail.inbox.count(on: Date.parse('2010-04-15'))
gmail.inbox.count(from: 'myfriend@gmail.com')
gmail.inbox.count(to: 'directlytome@gmail.com')
```

```ruby
# Combine flags and options
gmail.inbox.count(:unread, from: 'myboss@gmail.com')
```

```ruby
# Labels work the same way as inbox
gmail.mailbox('Urgent').count
```

```ruby
# Getting messages works the same way as counting: optional flag, and optional arguments
# Remember that every message in a conversation/thread will come as a separate message.
gmail.inbox.emails(:unread, before: Date.parse('2010-04-20'), from: 'myboss@gmail.com')
```

```ruby
# Search the same way you do on Gmail's web interface:
gmail.inbox.emails(gm: 'before:2010-02-20 after:2010-03-20')
gmail.inbox.emails(gm: 'on:2010-04-15')
gmail.inbox.emails(gm: 'from:myfriend@gmail.com')
gmail.inbox.emails(gm: 'to:myfriend@gmail.com')
gmail.inbox.emails(gm: 'is:read from:myboss@gmail.com "you are a great employee"')
```

```ruby
# Get messages without marking them as read on the server.
gmail.peek = true
gmail.inbox.emails(:unread, before: Date.parse('2010-04-20'), from: 'myboss@gmail.com')
```

### 4) Work with emails!
```ruby
# any news older than 4-20, mark as read and archive it...
gmail.inbox.emails(before: Date.parse('2010-04-20'), from: 'news@nbcnews.com').each do |email|
  email.mark(:read) # can also mark :unread or :spam
  email.archive!
end
```

```ruby
# delete emails from X...
gmail.inbox.emails(from: 'x-fianc√©@gmail.com').each do |email|
  email.delete!
end
```

```ruby
# Save all attachments in the "Faxes" label to a folder
folder = '/where/ever'

gmail.mailbox('Faxes').emails.each do |email|
  email.attachments.each do |attachment|
    file = File.new(folder + attachment.filename, "w+")
    file << attachment.decoded
    file.close
  end
end
```

```ruby
# Add a label to a message
email.label('Faxes')
```

```ruby
# Or "move" the message to a label
email.move_to('Faxes')
```

### 5) Create new emails!

Creating emails now uses the amazing [Mail](http://rubygems.org/gems/mail) rubygem. See its [documentation here](http://github.com/mikel/mail). Ruby-gmail will automatically configure your Mail emails to be sent via your Gmail account's SMTP, so they will be in your Gmail's "Sent" folder. Also, no need to specify the "From" email either, because ruby-gmail will set it for you.

```ruby
gmail.deliver do

  to      'email@example.com'
  subject 'Having fun in Puerto Rico!'
  
  text_part do
    body 'Text of plaintext message.'
  end

  html_part do
    content_type 'text/html; charset=UTF-8'
    body         '<p>Text of <em>html</em> message.</p>'
  end

  add_file '/path/to/some_image.jpg'
end

# Or, generate the message first and send it later
email = gmail.generate_message do
  to      'email@example.com'
  subject 'Having fun in Puerto Rico!'
  body    'Spent the day on the road...'
end

email.deliver!
# Or...
gmail.deliver(email)
```

## Requirements

* ruby
* net/smtp
* net/imap
* tmail
* shared-mime-info rubygem (for MIME-detection when attaching files)

## Install
